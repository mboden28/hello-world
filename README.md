## About Me

I currently live in Washington state, but originally from Huntington Beach, California. I joined the U.S. Army in 2010 and spent 8 years at two different duty locations; Fort Stewart, GA and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA. I left the active duty in December of 2017 and joined the Washington Army National Guard where I am an Air Defense C2 Systems Integrator Chief Warrant Officer 2. I also work as a Compliance Officer for Skookum Creek Tobacco Company in Shelton, WA. I am married to my wife Michelle and have three children, Ian (19), AJ (12), and Jake(10).
